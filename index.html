    Rohingya repatriation: Can we ever find a viable scheme?
</h2>
<p>
    Bangladesh currently faces a perplexing situation regarding the repatriation of over one million
    Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. Since 2017, several bilateral attempts, including visits and
    exchanges, have achieved little success. The diplomatic efforts for repatriation are seemingly
    running in circles without the prospect of the Rohingya returning to their homeland any time 
    soon. So far, the road map to repatriation is tainted with coercion, violence, intimidation 
    of the refugees at the camps in Cox's Bazar, and continued disenfranchisement of the Rohingya in
    Myanmar. To add to that, the recent renewed fighting between the armed rebel groups and the
    Myanmar junta may further push back the ongoing repatriation plan due to lack of peace and
    stability inside Myanmar.

<p>
    As it stands, the recent repatriation deal brokered by China offers very little in terms of
    restoration of the rights of the Rohingya people. The deal in effect compromises citizenship
    for the so-called National Verification Card (NVC) for repatriated families. Furthermore,
    the Rohingya are now being offered "model villages" for resettlement, despite their clear
    rejection of the repatriation scheme earlier. The Myanmar officials made no commitment for
    the refugees' repatriation to their original homes during the recent visit to Cox's Bazar.
    In all of this, Bangladesh officials seem indifferent to holding dialogues around reconciliation,
    security, and Rohingya rights as conditions for repatriation. Instead, many speculate that
    Bangladesh is looking towards short-term fixes to resolve the crisis bilaterally, with Chinese
    aid and assistance.
